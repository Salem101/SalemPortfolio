## Welcome to my Portfollio!

You can checkout some of my projects on my GitHub (https://github.com/Salem101?tab=repositories) page. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

Languages: 
-Java
-Python

Things I hope to accomplish this year: 
1. Become a better programmer
2. Become fluent in Hebrew

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Salem101/SalemPortfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
